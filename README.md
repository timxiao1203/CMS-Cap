# CMS-Cap
CMS stands for constant maturity swap. A CMS cap/floor consist of a number of caplet/floorlet on the index rate of a CMS rate. Pricing a CMS cap/floor is equivalent to price a portfolio of a continuum of vanilla interest rate swaptions. The SABR model is applied to evaluate the replicating interest rate swaption portfolio.
